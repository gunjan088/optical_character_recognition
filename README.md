## OCR Model Summary

# Overview
The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) project employs machine learning techniques to accurately recognize alphabetic characters from images. The project has multiple stages: data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

# Challenges & Solutions
The challenges faced such as high image noise levels, limited dataset availability, and the need for generalization to new images. Various pre-processing techniques were used to tackle these issues, resulting in a 2% increase in model accuracy.

# Performance
The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, with Support Vector Machines achieving the accuracy of 83% and 87% for CNN. The project also explored other algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, CNN, and Ensemble Learning.

# Future Work
My focus moving forward is to continue improving the model's robustness and accuracy using advanced machine learning techniques and additional data.
